### Project Description: Predicting House Prices Using Regression Analysis
In this project, I built a supervised machine learning model to predict house prices using the California Housing dataset.
The goal was to explore how different regression algorithms perform in forecasting median house values based on features like income, house age, population, and more.

### Key Components
Dataset: California Housing dataset (sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing)
Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor
Feature Selection: Correlation matrix analysis for identifying impactful features
Model Evaluation: RMSE, MAE, R² Score + actual vs predicted price plots
Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### Highlights
Compared multiple regression models to find the most accurate predictor.
Visualized feature relationships using a heatmap.
Delivered a clean and well-commented notebook for easy understanding.

### What I Learned
✅ The importance of feature relationships in driving model performance
✅ How tree-based models like Random Forest handle non-linear patterns better
✅ The value of combining metrics (RMSE, MAE, R²) for robust evaluation
